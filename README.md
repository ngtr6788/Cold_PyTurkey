# Cold PyTurkey

I decided to extend the functionality of Cold Turkey, a website blocking software (getcoldturkey.com). So far, I coded in Pomodoro timers and scheduling, and I improved the CLI interfact a little bit. I wish to add more features, but I'm super busy.

For now, I'm going to slightly improve on the PyTurkey API.

# WISHLIST:

- Implement a "make-shift" pomodoro timer (Improved it)
- Implement a night Frozen Turkey block that runs to 1:30AM next day.
- Implement scheduling via Python. (DONE)
- Make a "mealbreak" Frozen Turkey block for 1.5h, like lunch or dinner.
- Find a way to block applications via Python.
- Notifications, on-screen timers, etc.
- Implement a "start block until certain time" function (DONE!)
